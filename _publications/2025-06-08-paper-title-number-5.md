excerpt: 'Studies have shown that acute stress is highly related to human physical and mental health. A standardized and effective acute stress induction paradigm under controlled experimental conditions is essential for the research in these fields. However，in recent years，there are various paradigms and different effects of acute stress induction experiments. This paper reviews the progress of various types of acute stress induction paradigms under experimental control，and discusses the stressors，experimental processes， techniques used and their effects，to provide reference for the research in related fields.'
