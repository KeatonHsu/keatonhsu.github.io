excerpt: '急性应激与人类的身心健康高度相关，在实验控制条件下的、标准化的、有效的急性应激 诱导范式对上述领域的研究至关重要。近年来，急性应激诱导范式多样，效果不一。文章对实验室中 的各类急性应激诱导范式的进展进行综述，对其采用的应激源、实验流程、主要技术和效果进行讨论， 以期对相关领域的研究提供参考。(Studies have shown that acute stress is highly related to human physical and mental health. A standardized and effective acute stress induction paradigm under controlled experimental conditions is essential for the research in these fields. However，in recent years，there are various paradigms and different effects of acute stress induction experiments. This paper reviews the progress of various types of acute stress induction paradigms under experimental control，and discusses the stressors，experimental processes， techniques used and their effects，to provide reference for the research in related fields.)'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
